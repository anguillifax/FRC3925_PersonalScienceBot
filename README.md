# FRC3925_PersonalScienceBot
FIRST Robotics Team 3925's code for the practice robot.


This is a base project for FRC team 3925's 2015-2016 practice robot. This repository will be cloned whenever a new testing project is started.

<b>Do not use any part of this project that you do not understand.</b> This project is supposed to be a tool that allows new tests to be created quickly. It is not supposed to be a "black box" project. <i>You should be able to replicate the functionality of the class you are going to use before you clone it from here.</i>
